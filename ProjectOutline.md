# Capstone Project

## Sub-Title
1. Project Scope
- **Goal**: Build a platform that ingests business data, applies AI for predictions/recommendations, and presents insights via a web and mobile app.
- **Tracks**:
  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI): Predictive modeling, Natural Langauge Processing (NLP), or recommendation engine.
  - BUSINESS & DATA ANALYTICS (BDA): Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), dashboards, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) definitions.
  - SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (SD): Full-stack app, API integration, deployment.

2. 10-Week Timeline
   
    | Week | Milestone                     | Activities                                                                               |
    | ---- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 1    | Kickoff & Planning            | Define problem, roles, tech stack, success metrics. Gather datasets.                     |
    | 2    | Design Phase                  | Data schema, model architecture, UI wireframes.                                          |
    | 3    | Data Prep & EDA               | BDA team cleans data, performs EDA, defines KPIs. AI team explores features.             |
    | 4    | Model Development             | AI team builds baseline ML model. BDA finalizes dashboards. SD sets up backend skeleton. |
    | 5    | Model Refinement & API Design | AI improves accuracy. SD creates API endpoints for model inference.                      |
    | 6    | Front-End Development         | SD builds UI components. Integrate dashboards (iframe or API).                           |
    | 7    | Integration Sprint            | Connect AI model → API → Front-end/Mobile. Test data flow end-to-end.                    |
    | 8    | Testing & QA                  | Unit tests, integration tests, performance checks.                                       |
    | 9    | Deployment                    | Deploy app to cloud (AWS/Azure/Heroku). Validate CI/CD pipeline.                         |
    | 10   | Final Presentation            | Prepare demo, documentation, and business report.                                        |
